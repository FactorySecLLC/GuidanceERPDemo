This is a demo version of the main FactorySec Guidance ERP. It uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Express/CouchDB.

You'll want to install CouchDB for this for the database.

Create a .env file and put the following:

COUCHDB_USER=
COUCHDB_PASSWORD=

Then fill out your CouchDB username and password there.

In the IDE (integrated development environment) you use, such as maybe Visual Studio Code, open the folder for this program, go to the terminal, then type in "npm install" without the quotes and press enter to install the dependencies for this program.

To run the program, type in "node server.js" in the terminal in the IDE without the quotes while in the root folder for this program. Then, in your browser, type in "localhost:3000" without the quotes and press enter.
