This program is currently meant to run on 1 computer or vrtual machine locally without connecting to a network. This is for security and simplicity purposes.

If you want multiple people to be able to view this information and edit it, consider putting this program on a virtual machine that can be accessed remotely, and follow relevant security practices.

Please don't edit the code for the purpose of connecting the program directly with a network, thus introducing issues with encrypting data in transit and other vulnerabilities from not forcing localhost.

Keeping the technology stack minimal is part of the goal of this program. Introducing HTTPS into this if the data is kept on localhost anyways can introduce more technologies that need to be upkept for this program.
